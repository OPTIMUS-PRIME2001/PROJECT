-----Thank You for downloading our software-----
There are, however, a few steps that are needed to be completed for the software to
run efficiently:-

1. Please update your Python version if not already, to v3.9 or higher.
	[You could always check your Python version by typing the following 
		command on cmd: python -V ]

2. [IMPORTANT!] Install the following extensions on VS Code:
	1.1. Pylance
	1.2. Python
	1.3. Intellicode
	1.4. Github Pull Requests and Issues

3. For Python v3.9 you need to install the 'pillow' library by typing the following 
	command on VS Code Terminal: pip install pillow
	[For version higher than v3.9 it comes pre-installed, still its better to 
		check by typing the same command on the Terminal]

4. Please install the "technology" font on your system. You can download it
	from our Github.
